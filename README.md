# Hi, I'm Alex.

- 🐍 I've been coding in Python primarily for over 2 years
- 👷‍♂️ I currently work as a full stack developer (backend-heavy) with Django and Django REST as my main frameworks
- 😊 I occasionally work with other languages like Javascript and Go.
- 🏫 I am currently learning and building a cross-platform desktop application with Electron and Node.js   
- 💪 Working with and learning new technologies is a gladly-welcomed challenge for me
